# Data Types in python
### Below is the list of Data Types in python:

	1. Integers - Whole numbers 3, 300, 200
	2. Floating point - Demical numbers 2.3, 4.6, 200.3
	3. Strings - Ordered sequence of characters "Hello", "Sammy", "20"
	4. Lists - Ordered sequence of objects [10, "Hello, 200.3]
	5. Dictionaries - Unordered key:value pairs {"mykey" : "value"}
	6. Tuples - Ordered immutable sequence of objects (10, "Hello")
	7. Sets - Unordered collection of unique objects {"a", "b"}
	8. Booleans - Logical value indicating True or False

If we look at the output for strings, lists and tuples, they are in same order as they are specified intially. And these data structures guarantee this order. This are called ordered collection.

If we look at the result of sets and dictionary, initial order, the order in which we specified the elements, is not maintained. This are unordered collection.
