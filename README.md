# Python Basics

This repo is basically my journey towards learning python.
Let's start with installing python.

## **Installation of python**
Before we drive into installing python, lets see some very basic commands that we use in cmd(command prompt) in window or terminal in Mac and Linux machines.

    Most regularly used commands in Window machine are:
      1. cd -> shows you the current file path.
      2. dir -> shows the files and folders under the current directory.
      3. cd <file or folder name> -> to get into a file or folder present inside current directory e.g. cd Documents.
      4. cd .. -> to move up(back) a directory.
      5. cls .. -> to clear command prompt.
  
    Most regularly used commands in Mac or Linux machine are:
      1. pwd -> shows you the current file path "print working directory".
      2. ls -> shows the files and folders under the current directory.Display the name of files and subdirectories in the directory.
      3. cd <file or folder name> -> to get into a file or folder present inside current directory e.g. cd Documents.
      4. cd .. -> to move up(back) a directory.
      5. clear .. -> to clear terminal.
